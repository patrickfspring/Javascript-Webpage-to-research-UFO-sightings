javascript challenge

The purpose of this project is to be able to display a table of reported UFO sightings and be able to filter and search the sightings by date.  The page loads the table with all sightings with the initial load and reloads all sightings upon refresh. 

The project contents are the following:
(1.) Static file with the CSS and images subfolders.  The CSS content was updated for this homework project.
(2.) The js folder with the data and app scripts. 
(3.) The index html file, which was also updated for this homework project. 
(4.) The UFO-level-2 file was not not accessed due to time constraints.
