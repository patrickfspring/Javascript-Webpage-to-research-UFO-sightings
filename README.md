Javascript Webpage development to research UFO sightings 

Summary:
The purpose of this project was to display a table of reported UFO sightings and be able to filter and search the sightings by date. The webpage loads
the table with all sightings with the initial load and reloads all sightings upon refresh.  The following technologies used were: Javascript, HTML, CSS, 
and D3.js.

Delivered contents are as follows:
1.) A static file with the CSS and images subfolders. The CSS content was updated for this task.
2.) The js folder with the data and app scripts. 
3.) The index html file, which was also updated for this effort. 
4.) The UFO-level-2 file was not used/accessed due to a time limitation.
